**Dice Roll Python Program**

This Python script simulates a dice roll by generating two random integers between 1 and 6, mimicking the roll of two dice. Users can repeatedly roll the dice by inputting "yes" or "y", with each roll providing a new random result. It's a simple yet effective exercise for beginners to practice using the random module and handling user input in Python.
