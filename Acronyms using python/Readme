Acronym Generator
This Python project generates acronyms from a given phrase. The program takes user input, splits the sentence into individual words, and creates an acronym by extracting the first letter of each word and converting it to uppercase. Itâ€™s a great tool to practice Python string manipulation and improve your logical skills, useful for coding interviews.
