**Spelling Corrector**


This Python script uses the pyspellchecker library to correct spelling errors in user-provided input. It initializes a spell checker, processes the input text to identify and correct misspelled words, and then outputs both the original and corrected text. The script handles user input by replacing commas with spaces to better split the text into individual words.
