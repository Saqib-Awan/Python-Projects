**Digital Clock Using Tkinter**


This Python code creates a digital clock using the Tkinter library, providing a simple GUI application that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock's appearance, including font, color, and border, is customizable through Tkinter's Label widget. The digital_clock function updates the time every 200 milliseconds to keep the display current.
